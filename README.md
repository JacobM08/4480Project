# EECS 4480 Computer Security Project

   This is a project created by Jacob Medeiros of York University for the EECS 4480 Computer Security Project Course of the fourth year. 

## Abstract 
The purpose of this project is to understand how network traffic is captured and how unencrypted traffic can be analyzed. Additionally, the project aims to map a network topology and demonstrate what an adversary might look for when attempting lateral movement. Finally, the project explores a method of attack by implementing the Kaminsky attack.
